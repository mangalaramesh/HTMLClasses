<h3> <u>Education</u></h3> 
<h5>Post Secondary education</h5>
<p>
    In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at 
    Elphinstone High School. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, 
    Ramabai. The match per the customs prevailing at that time was arranged by the couple's parents</p> <br />
    <h5>Stidies at university at Bombay</h5>
    <p>In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elphinstone_High_School" title="wiki" target="_parent">Elphinstone College,</a>
    which was affiliated to the University of Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar 
    caste to do so. When he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted 
    to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion 
    compared to the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his 
    success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.[31]
    By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to
     take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started 
     work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.
